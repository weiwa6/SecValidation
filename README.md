# Security Validation with Cisco SecureX

## About this idea

It's one thing buying security controls for your endpoint, email etc., but what are you doing to confirm that they are alerting and reacting as you expect? In addition, is it a manual process that typically requires someone within the security team to proactively perform this testing to then highlight what success looks like?

With Cisco SecureX you can automate this process and deliver relevant information back to your team and management on how your investment in security is ensuring that your organisation is defended as intended and informed of any compromise attempt. It's an example of how through simple automation via SecureX you can change the way you perform the everyday task of securing your environment.

There are currently 3 type of events that can be generated by the scripts under "Modules" folder.

*   DNS events against Cisco Umbrella
*   Endpoint events against Cisco Secure Endpoint (fka AMP4E)
*   IPS events against Cisco NGFW

## How it works

There are multiple components required to automate the process. Here are the high level steps for each use case:

1.  SecureX Remote generate attack activity from SXO Remote, e.g. malicious DNS lookup against Umbrella VA
2.  Check expected result, e.g. DNS sinkhole address
3.  (Optional) Check SIEM logs, e.g. Splunk API query
4.  Check SxTR Sighting
5.  Update test result for Dashboard tile
6.  (Optional) Send notification, e.g. Webex message

## Prerequisite

*   SXO Remote VM deployed with ssh root access. Check [SecureX document](https://ciscosecurity.github.io/sxo-05-security-workflows/remote/setup) for details. 
*   SIEM integration with Cisco products. The workflows use Splunk with relevant Cisco TA configured. Please validate the query string against your environment.   
    If this is not required, please skip the relevant activities from SXO workflow.
*   Webex bot and credentials for sending message. Check [Webex and SecureX document](https://ciscosecurity.github.io/sxo-05-security-workflows/atomics/configuration/webex) for details.  
    If this is not required, please skip the relevant activities from SXO workflow.
